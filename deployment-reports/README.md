# Deployment Reports

This folder contains automated deployment reports generated by the DC Build Pipeline.

## 📄 Report Format

Each successful DC deployment automatically generates a detailed report with:

- ✅ VM Configuration (name, IP, OS)
- ✅ AD Service Status (NTDS, DNS, Netlogon, KDC)
- ✅ Replication Status (repadmin results)
- ✅ DCDiag Health Checks
- ✅ DNS Configuration (forwarders)
- ✅ LDAP/LDAPS Connectivity
- ✅ Overall Health Summary

## 📋 Naming Convention

Reports are named: `DC-Deployment-{VMName}-{Timestamp}.md`

Example: `DC-Deployment-FreshDC1446-2026-01-20_17-47-32.md`

## 🔍 Usage

2. **Review Report**: Open the latest report to see deployment details
3. **Verify Health**: Check overall status and any warnings
4. **Share Results**: Link to the report for team visibility
